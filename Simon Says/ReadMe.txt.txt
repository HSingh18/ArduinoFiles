CSC 113 Project 2

Summary
	Design and implement an embedded gaming system using digital IO, LEDs, Buttons and the Arduino board. 

Overview
	1. The system will display a random series of lights to the user (using LEDs)
	2. The user will have to repeat the series of lights using push buttons (Each button corresponds to one light or one LED)
	3. If the user succeeds to repeat the sequence the system will display a success feedback (flash status LED/s)
	4. If the user fails to repeat the sequence the system will display a failure feedback (flash status LED/s) 

System Components
	Arduino board
	LEDs
	Push buttons
	Wires
	Breadboard
