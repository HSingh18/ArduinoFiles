# Morse Code
CSC 113 Project 1

Summary
	Morse code is a character encoding scheme used in telecommunication that encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations called dots and dashes or dits and dahs.  

Overview
	Your task as an embedded systems designer is to recreate a simple Morse code transmission using optical transmission (blink LED). A user should be able to enter a numeric string.  The LED should pulse that number in morse code with a 5 second light pulse at the end to symbolize the end of transmission.  

System Components
	Arduino board

How it Works: 
	The user enters a string of digits. Then each digit is shown thru the LED with its respective morse code.
