CSC 113 Project 2

Summary
	Design and implement an embedded gaming system using digital IO, LEDs, Buttons and the Arduino board. 

Overview
	1. The system will display a random series of lights to the user (using LEDs)
	2. The user will have to repeat the series of lights using push buttons (Each button corresponds to one light or one LED)
	3. If the user succeeds to repeat the sequence the system will display a success feedback (flash status LED/s)
	4. If the user fails to repeat the sequence the system will display a failure feedback (flash status LED/s) 

System Components
	Arduino board
	LEDs
	Push buttons
	Wires
	Breadboard

How it Works: 
	The program starts by outputing a sequence of LED's. This sequence is generated by random numbers which correspond to the respective LED.
	Once the sequence has finished, its the user's turn to copy that sequence exactly as it was outpued. The user can do this by clicking the button which is connected to the respective LED. BUTTON1 == LED1
	Once the user has also inputted his sequence, the two are compared and one of two things will happen.
	One: The LED will blink one by one, 10 times, created a wave like effect which means that you were able to follow Simon
	Two: All LED's will turn on and off 4 times creating a flashing effect which means that you were not able to follow Simon
